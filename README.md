# GAN_mnist

This is a GAN for producing new mnist like images(images of numbers) using tenserflow and keras.
It uses a genarator(uses upsampling layers to generate images from random noise) and a discriminator(CNN).

It took me about 20 minutes per epoch, and after about 13 epoches it started to show digit like images :)
